Dear @Tawfik Mohamed Morsi

The email send below is highlighting issues that mistaken mentioned as “CRM Technical issues” where our implementation follows standard Siebel implementation process and validated by our experts where the Best in market for Siebel implementations some points below are BDC forced factors and other are as per Siebel standard. Where:

1-	Product Catalogue: There is no customization show in solution where sophisticating using different catalogues will not lead to any enhancements as this Bank implementation is not an e-Store. Catalogs and categories are currently used for product display.

2-	Corporate Deposit List Web Service: Corporate Customer 360 UAT had been taking around 6 months, so either the case run successfully and in this case it had been changed from bank side or the case had been cancelled from the business and in this case it should not be discussed now. 

Kindly note the below corrections:

Retail Customer BC - Contact BC
Corporate Customer BC - Account BC
